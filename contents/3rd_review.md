### Adding a workflow script

Thanks to Hyojekim, I finally added a working workflow script to my repository. The reason why it didn’t work on my GitHub pages was because of the branch name. Yes, the branch name was the main reason.

I recreated the repository and pushed it to branch main. And it did work!

You can find the workflow script on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/SaltySalt77/SaltySalt77.github.io).

### Start studying React

> **React**: A code library (built with JavaScript) for building user interfaces. It’s the framework that Gatsby uses to build pages and structure content.

I’ve started studying React on [42seoul.groom.io](https://42seoul.goorm.io/). But as you see from above, it’s a code library built with JavaScript. So I decided to learn Javascript basics.

### Adding comment feature on the blog

The initial restoring repo of blog comments is the theme creator’s repo. So, I had to update the `gatsby-meta-config.js` file.
I changed the repo in gatsby-meta-config.js file and deployed it. And then, ***BOOM!*** All of the comments were gone, like this.

I was in a panic. I’ve tried everything, but the comment didn’t come back. The next day, I was going to start from the beginning. Before deleting the repository of my blog, I compared the gatsby-meta-config.js file from others. And found out the difference.

```jsx
//wrong one
comment: {
	disqusShortName: '', // Your disqus-short-name. check disqus.com.
	utterances: 'SaltySalt77/blog_comments.git', // Your repository for archive comment
}
//right one
comment: {
	disqusShortName: '', // Your disqus-short-name. check disqus.com.
	utterances: 'SaltySalt77/blog_comments', // Your repository for archive comment
}
```


Did you find it? Yes, I had to add the repository name, not the link of the repository. After correcting the code, the comments feature came back. Like this.

### Translating Gatsby Official Tutorial Part 3

As you know, I’m Korean, so I participated in translating Gatsby Official Tutorial. While translating, I learned about how to install and use plugins.
