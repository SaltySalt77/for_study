### Listening to html5 & css3 lectures

I have planned to learn Javascript basics, but to learn Javascript, it required some background knowledge of html5 & css3. So I started listening to html5 & css3 lectures.  The lecture I have chosen was basics of them.

I have learned about tags and comments. My goal for next week is to complete the lecture course.

### Translate image in gatsby official tutorial part.0~2

I have done it, ‘cause I promised with Haryu to translate images at the last study meeting. I decided that only one was needed to be translated, and I translated only that.

Like [*this*](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/fe21f062-32e3-4f52-b4fd-cdce3daa6780/%EC%9D%B4%EB%AF%B8%EC%A7%801.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20220101%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20220101T025143Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-Signature=e9f04a13f9a1ebc7306852fa5fe0e1302061aa5fece9163b9ce438c6e7f9ec3a&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22%25EC%259D%25B4%25EB%25AF%25B8%25EC%25A7%25801.png%22&x-id=GetObject).

It's embarrassing to show my work to others, but I did my best.

### Start writing post about ‘How to start a gatsby blog with gatsby starter bee’.

I will write a post about how to start a gatsby blog with gatsby starter bee. I have thought about how to write it.

I’ll show it after I uploading the post.

### Find ‘share on Facebook’ component

In this theme, the ‘share on Facebook’ button doesn’t work. So I must fix it.

Before fixing it, I should know how the function works. I have found some codes , but I could not understand how it works. I think I must learn React first.

### What’s changed on the blog.

1. Changed copyright below the blog, Jbee to hyna.
