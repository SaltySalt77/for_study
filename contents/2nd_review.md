### Writing a workflow for auto-deploying  
#### ~ Monday  
I've tried many of them which came up while searching. But errors occurred while installing npm(`npm install`). So I changed the way for auto-deploying. I wrote a shell script! And this is it.
```shell
#!/bin/bash
git add .
git commit -m "$(date)"
git push origin master
npm run deploy
git checkout gh-pages
git pull origin gh-pages
git add .
git commit -m "$(date)"
git push origin gh-pages
git checkout master
npm install
```
It pushes source codes to branch master with commit message(date) and pushes deployed files to branch gh-pages.  

#### Tuesday
I peeped in Hyojekim\_space and saw `nodejs version occurred errors`. So I simply added code of setting nodejs version in a workflow. And it did work!  
It worked but it pushed the deployed files not on branch gh-pages, on master. So I went to Github pages, read readme files, and found that it pushes the deployed files on branch master in default.  

### Changed profile images and site tab images.
I've changed profile images and site tab images.  
These images are found in the `content/assets` directory.
